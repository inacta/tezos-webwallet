==========

A web wallet for users and developers on the Tezos blockchain

This web wallet supports secret key handling in various formats,
and a wide range of functionality such as tez balance checking,
token balance checking, token deployment, tez and token
transactions, and a dynamic interface to read and call any
endpoint in a deployed contract. This dynamic interface utilizes
Tezos' unique typed assembly language which allows any application
to dynamically read the function signatures of endpoints for any
deployed Tezos smart contract. This web wallet supports both
mainnet and test net, and in the settings panel, the user can
control which Tezos node they use as a backend.

The web wallet does not rely on any other backend than a Tezos
node.
